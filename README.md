**#PRE-REQUISITE**
The pre-requisite of this project is that you have already learned SV constructs, constrained randomization, and have some amount of basic knowledge to UVM-Library.

**#YOU WILL LEARN**
In this project you will learn how to setup your testbench ideally. How to use vcs and make use of uvm in vcs. Learn vcs commands, create filelist for including your source files, remove circular dependecy for compilation.
Know how to run a simulation, view waves. Also you will get to learn Makefile to create commands to build the env and run regressions.

In this Project you will get to learn AMBA-APB protocol, Testplanning, Coverage Planning, Test Bench Creation and Overall full scale verification of APB protocol.
APB protocol is a non-pipelined simple protocol, used to connect low bandwidth peripheral that do not require highspeed IOs like AXI. It is used in the industry widely for mainly communication between two IPs or a way to do configuration register writes.

In this project you will also learn how to setup a basic Tree for your project, Learn VCS for simulation.

PLease go through apb_dut spec, apb_testplan in that order
